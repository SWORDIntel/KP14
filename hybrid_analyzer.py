# Research Notes on Hybrid Analysis Techniques
# --------------------------------------------
# 1. Definition: Hybrid analysis combines static analysis (examining code without execution)
#    and dynamic analysis (observing behavior during execution) to achieve more
#    comprehensive understanding and overcome limitations of each approach alone.
#
# 2. Goals:
#    - Validate static findings: Dynamic execution can confirm if statically found vulnerabilities
#      are reachable or if certain code paths are actually taken.
#    - Enhance static analysis: Dynamic information (e.g., resolved indirect calls, decrypted strings,
#      observed variable values) can enrich static models of the program.
#    - Contextualize dynamic findings: Static analysis can provide context for observed dynamic
#      behaviors (e.g., mapping an API call sequence back to specific functions or modules).
#    - Improve coverage: Use static analysis to guide dynamic execution towards unexplored code paths.
#    - Deobfuscation: Combine static pattern matching with dynamic unpacking/decryption observation.
#
# 3. Techniques/Examples:
#    - Symbolic-assisted dynamic analysis: Use symbolic execution on paths observed dynamically.
#    - Dynamic data to resolve static ambiguities: e.g., values of opaque predicates, targets of indirect jumps.
#    - Static CFG augmentation with dynamic traces: Add edges or nodes to CFG based on runtime behavior.
#    - Taint analysis: Static taint analysis can identify potential flows; dynamic analysis can confirm
#      if tainted data actually propagates to sinks under specific inputs.
#    - Concolic execution (Dynamic Symbolic Execution): Executes concretely while simultaneously
#      collecting symbolic constraints to explore alternative paths.
#
# 4. Challenges:
#    - Correlation: Mapping dynamic events (e.g., memory addresses, instruction pointers at runtime)
#      back to static constructs (e.g., variable names, source lines, function definitions),
#      especially with ASLR, packers, or JIT code.
#    - State Space: Managing and correlating potentially large amounts of data from both analyses.
#    - Scalability: Performing deep hybrid analysis can be resource-intensive.
#    - Tool Integration: Requires robust ways to pass data between different analysis tools/phases.
#
# 5. Relevance to KEYPLUG:
#    - Could correlate `DecompilerIntegration` (static) with `IntelPTAnalyzer` (dynamic execution path).
#    - Could use resolved types from `TypePropagator` (static) to interpret memory dumps or runtime values from Pin tools.
#    - Could verify `VulnerabilityDetector` findings (static regex/ML) by checking if PT traces hit those lines.
#    - Could use `SymbolicExecutor` results to guide dynamic tracing or vice-versa.
