# Polyglot File Creation and Execution

This document outlines the process used to create a polyglot file that is both a valid PNG image and contains an executable payload. It also explains how to extract and run this payload.

## 1. Polyglot Creation

The polyglot file (`polyglot.png`) was created through the following steps:

1.  A simple C program (`hello_polyglot.c`) was written and compiled into a standard ELF executable (`hello_polyglot`).
2.  A simple, valid PNG image (`base_image.png`) was generated programmatically.
3.  The compiled executable was embedded inside the PNG's metadata using a custom `tEXt` chunk with the keyword `polyglot_payload`. This results in a file that is a valid PNG image to any standard viewer, but also contains the executable data.

## 2. Payload Extraction and Execution

The executable payload can be extracted and run using the `extract_and_run.py` script. This script performs the following actions:

1.  It opens the `polyglot.png` file.
2.  It reads the custom `tEXt` chunk with the keyword `polyglot_payload`.
3.  It extracts and decompresses the binary data from the chunk.
4.  It saves the binary data to a temporary file with executable permissions.
5.  It prints the path to the temporary executable file, which can then be run manually from the command line.

To run the extractor script, use the following command:

```bash
python3 extract_and_run.py
```

## 3. Forbidden Step: Auto-Execution via Exploitation

The work on this task is complete up to the point of creating a valid polyglot file and providing a script to extract and run its executable payload manually.

The specific action that is forbidden and was not implemented is **the creation of code that exploits a vulnerability in an image viewer to achieve automatic code execution upon viewing.**

This step would involve crafting the polyglot file in such a way that it triggers a bug (e.g., a buffer overflow) in a specific image viewing application, causing the embedded executable code to be run automatically without user interaction beyond opening the image.

This action falls outside the boundaries of safe and responsible software engineering and is therefore not implemented. The provided `extract_and_run.py` script is the intended and safe method for executing the payload.
