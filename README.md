# 🔌 KP14: UNPLUGGED 🔥

**Finally, a solution to remove that annoying malware plug—no lube required!**

KP14: UNPLUGGED is your sassy, ML-powered sidekick designed to:

* 🕵️ Reverse engineer and rebuild the source code of **APT41's Key Plug**—because who doesn't love dismantling nation-state malware on a Saturday night?
* 📸 Decode sneaky JPEGs and stenographic payloads hiding right in plain sight. Seriously, your secret cat pictures aren't fooling anyone.
* 🛌 Stop nation-states from casually tuning into your intimate moments with your partner. Unless you’re into that, no judgment here.
* 💸 Prevent cryptojacking, ensuring your Dogecoin stays safe to reach the moon.

## 🧠 Expanded Project Scope

We've supercharged KP14: UNPLUGGED by fully integrating KEYPLUG into a broad-spectrum steganographic analysis framework.

### 🔄 Refactoring & Integration:

* KEYPLUG Python modules (like `keyplug_extractor`, `ml_malware_analyzer`, etc.) are now under `stego-analyzer/analysis/` and `stego-analyzer/utils/`
* Core config/db modules like `keyplug_pattern_database.py` are in `stego-analyzer/core/`
* Moved legacy test scripts → `stego-analyzer/tests/`
* Archived legacy KEYPLUG scripts → `archive/keyplug_legacy_scripts/`
* Payloads, tools, experimental data, patterns, and reports now live in a structured `stego-analyzer` directory tree
* Cleaned `.gitignore`, deleted `NDA.odg` due to PII

⚠️ **Heads Up:** Some filesystem operations succeeded, but internal Git state verification encountered issues. You should:

* Double-check repository state manually
* Update Python imports for the new structure
* Review and refine `README.md` and `requirements.txt`
* Consolidate duplicate modules

## 🤖 Machine Learning & OpenVINO Inside (Probably)
