Payload Reconstruction Module.

This module provides functions to attempt to reconstruct meaningful data
or source code from an extracted payload. For instance, if a payload seems
to be obfuscated or fragmented code.

    Attempts to reconstruct or deobfuscate the source from payload data.
    This is a placeholder. Real reconstruction might involve:
    - Decompressing data (zlib, gzip).
    - Deobfuscating scripts (hex, base64, custom XOR).
    - Assembling fragmented data.
    - Identifying file types from magic numbers.

    Args:
        payload_data (bytes): The raw payload data extracted from an image.

    Returns:
        str | None: A string representing the reconstructed data (e.g., source code, text),
                    or None if reconstruction is not possible or fails.
