# Mandatory: opencv-python, numpy, pillow
# Optional (for ML acceleration): openvino, torch, tensorflow

# --- Mandatory Dependencies ---
opencv-python==4.8.0.76
numpy==1.26.4
Pillow==10.0.1
pycparser==2.21
matplotlib==3.8.0 # For visualization utilities
capstone==5.0.1
pefile==2023.2.7

# --- Optional Dependencies (for ML acceleration and advanced features) ---
# openvino==2024.1.0
# torch==2.1.0 # Consider CPU-only version for broader compatibility if GPU not present: torch==2.1.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
# tensorflow==2.15.0 # Consider CPU-only version: tensorflow-cpu==2.15.0

# --- Other direct dependencies identified (verify if truly direct or transitive) ---
# These were captured by pip freeze. Review and remove if they are transitive dependencies
# handled by the main packages above, or if they are not directly imported by stego-analyzer's own code.
# Keeping some common ones that might be directly used or are small enough not to cause issues.

# Dependencies of matplotlib, numpy, etc. (usually automatically handled but good to list stable versions)
contourpy==1.3.2
cycler==0.12.1
fonttools==4.58.1
kiwisolver==1.4.8
packaging==25.0
python-dateutil==2.9.0.post0
six==1.16.0 # Very common utility, often a direct or indirect need

# Dependencies of openvino (if openvino is uncommented above)
# openvino-telemetry>=2023.2.1 # Example, version might need adjustment based on openvino version

# Note: If specific versions of torch/tensorflow CPU are desired, the pip install command might differ.
# e.g., for torch CPU: pip install torch==2.1.0+cpu torchvision==0.16.0+cpu torchaudio==2.1.0+cpu -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
