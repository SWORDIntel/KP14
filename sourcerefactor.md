    void (*decrypt)(unsigned char* data, size_t len, unsigned char* key, size_t key_len);
    const char* name;
} CryptoAlgorithm;

// Implementations based on samples
CryptoAlgorithm xor_algorithm;
CryptoAlgorithm multi_xor_algorithm;

```

2. **Steganography Module:**
```c
// stego.h
typedef struct {
    unsigned char* (*extract)(const char* carrier_file, size_t* out_size);
    int (*embed)(const char* carrier_file, const char* output_file, 
                 unsigned char* payload, size_t payload_size);
} StegoMethod;

// Based on JPEG techniques found
StegoMethod jpeg_offset_method;  // Sample 3's approach
StegoMethod jpeg_section_method; // Sample 2's approach
```

3. **Execution Module:**
```c
// execution.h
typedef struct {
    int (*execute_payload)(unsigned char* payload, size_t size);
    int (*analyze_payload)(unsigned char* payload, size_t size, char** output);
} ExecutionEngine;

// Based on function structures identified

ExecutionEngine memory_execution;
```

### Sample Integration Strategy

## Usage Examples

```c
// Example 1: Basic Extraction and Decryption
int extract_and_decrypt(const char* jpeg_file) {
    size_t payload_size = 0;
    unsigned char* payload = jpeg_offset_method.extract(jpeg_file, &payload_size);
    
    // Try Sample 3's key
    unsigned char key = 0xff;
    unsigned char* decrypted = malloc(payload_size);
    xor_algorithm.decrypt(payload, payload_size, &key, 1);
    
    // Save result
    FILE* fp = fopen("decrypted.bin", "wb");
    fwrite(decrypted, 1, payload_size, fp);
    fclose(fp);
    
    free(payload);
    free(decrypted);
    return 0;
}

// Example 2: Multi-Layer Approach
int multi_layer_extraction(const char* jpeg_file) {
    // Extract using Sample 2's technique
    size_t payload_size = 0;
    unsigned char* payload = jpeg_section_method.extract(jpeg_file, &payload_size);
    
    // Apply combined key sequence (9e+d3+b63c1e94)
    unsigned char keys[] = {0x9e, 0xd3, 0xb6, 0x3c, 0x1e, 0x94};
    unsigned char* decrypted = malloc(payload_size);
    multi_xor_algorithm.decrypt(payload, payload_size, keys, 6);
    
    // Analyze the result
    char* analysis = NULL;
    analyze_payload(decrypted, payload_size, &analysis);
    printf("Analysis: %s\n", analysis);
    
    free(payload);
    free(decrypted);
