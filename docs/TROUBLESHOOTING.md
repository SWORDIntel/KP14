### TD-002: Monolithic Configuration Management

**Priority:** P1 - High
**Type:** Architecture
**Debt Age:** 7 months (since 2025-03-01)
**Interest Rate:** High (impacts extensibility)

#### Description
Configuration is currently handled via a single `settings.ini` file parsed into a global `Config` object. This approach has limitations:
- No validation of configuration values
- No type safety (all values are strings)
- Difficult to extend for plugins
- No environment-specific overrides (dev, staging, prod)
- No secrets management integration

#### Impact
- **Extensibility:** Hard to add configuration for new modules
- **Deployment:** Cannot use environment variables for containerization best practices
- **Security:** Secrets stored in plaintext configuration file
- **Usability:** Configuration errors detected at runtime, not startup

#### Root Cause
- Quick implementation for MVP
- Grew organically without refactoring
- No formal configuration schema

#### Remediation Plan

**Phase 1: Schema and Validation (15 hours - Q4 2025)**
- Define Pydantic models for all configuration sections
- Implement validation at load time
- Add type conversion and defaults
- Preserve backward compatibility with settings.ini

**Phase 2: Environment and Secrets (10 hours - Q1 2026)**
- Support environment variable overrides (12-factor app)
- Integrate with secrets management (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Multi-environment configuration (dev, staging, prod)
- Configuration hot-reloading (no restart required)

**Phase 3: Plugin Configuration (5 hours - Q2 2026)**
- Plugin-specific configuration namespaces
- Schema registration for plugins
- Configuration UI generation from schemas

#### Example (After Remediation)

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class PEAnalyzerConfig(BaseModel):
    enabled: bool = True
    max_file_size_mb: int = 100
    scan_on_import: bool = False
    hash_algorithms: list[str] = ["md5", "sha1", "sha256"]

    @validator('max_file_size_mb')
    def validate_size(cls, v):
        if v < 1 or v > 1000:
            raise ValueError('Must be between 1 and 1000 MB')
        return v

# Usage
config = PEAnalyzerConfig.parse_obj(config_dict)
```

#### Acceptance Criteria
- ✓ Pydantic models for all configuration sections
- ✓ Environment variable support (e.g., `KP14_PE_MAX_SIZE=200`)
- ✓ Secrets never stored in plaintext
- ✓ Configuration errors caught at startup
- ✓ Backward compatibility with existing settings.ini
