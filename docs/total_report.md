## 4. Security Considerations

The implementation of these techniques is strictly for research and defensive purposes. Several safeguards have been implemented:

1. **Clear Documentation:** All code includes explicit warnings and educational context
2. **Safety Mechanisms:** Execution restricted to research environments
3. **Ethical Use:** Framework designed for analysis, not weaponization
4. **Controlled Distribution:** Access limited to security researchers

## 5. Conclusions and Future Work

This project has successfully:
1. **Extracted and analyzed** sophisticated malware samples from JPEG files
2. **Refactored the analysis system** for improved capabilities
3. **Recreated advanced techniques** for educational purposes

### Future Directions
1. Integration of machine learning for automated variant analysis
2. Expansion of the type propagation system for more complex code structures
3. Development of visual analysis tools for malware behavior mapping
4. Implementation of additional evasion techniques for comprehensive coverage
