## Immediate Actions Required

### Week 1: Critical Security & Stability

**Goal:** Achieve 80/100 score

#### 1. Fix Security Issues (2 days)

**MD5/SHA1 Replacement:**
```python
# BEFORE (INSECURE):
md5 = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()

# AFTER (For file identification - non-security):
md5 = hashlib.md5(data, usedforsecurity=False).hexdigest()

# AFTER (For security purposes):
sha256 = hashlib.sha256(data).hexdigest()
```

**Files to Update (Priority Order):**
1. `keyplug_results_processor.py`
2. `stego-analyzer/analysis/keyplug_extractor.py`
3. `stego-analyzer/analysis/keyplug_decompiler.py`
4. `stego-analyzer/analysis/keyplug_advanced_analysis.py`

**ARC4 Migration:**
```python
# BEFORE (DEPRECATED):
from Crypto.Cipher import ARC4
cipher = ARC4.new(key)

# AFTER (MODERN):
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms
cipher = Cipher(algorithms.ARC4(key), mode=None)
```

**Files to Update:**
- `stego-analyzer/analysis/keyplug_advanced_analysis.py`
- `stego-analyzer/utils/multi_layer_decrypt.py`
- `stego-analyzer/utils/rc4_decrypt.py`

#### 2. Install Missing Dependencies (1 day)

```bash
# In kp14_qa_venv:
pip install numpy jpegio Pillow pycryptodome pyca/cryptography

# Update requirements.txt:
echo "numpy>=1.26.4" >> requirements.txt
echo "jpegio>=0.5.0" >> requirements.txt
echo "Pillow>=10.0.1" >> requirements.txt
echo "cryptography>=41.0.0" >> requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Refactor High-Complexity Functions (2 days)

**Priority Order:**
1. `core_engine/pipeline_manager.py:run_pipeline()` - Complexity 36
2. `stego_test.py:embed_message_f5()` - Complexity 33
3. `keyplug_results_processor.py:_write_summary_report()` - Complexity 25
4. `core_engine/file_validator.py:validate_file()` - Complexity 23
5. `stego_test.py:embed_message_jsteg()` - Complexity 22

**Approach:**
- Extract helper methods
- Use early returns to reduce nesting
- Split into smaller, focused functions
- Target: Reduce all to <15 complexity

## Risk Assessment

### Production Deployment Risks

| Risk | Severity | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Crypto vulnerabilities | HIGH | Medium | Critical | Fix all MD5/SHA1 usage |
| Code complexity bugs | MEDIUM | High | High | Refactor complex functions |
| Untested code paths | HIGH | High | Critical | Increase test coverage to 80% |
| Missing dependencies | MEDIUM | Medium | Medium | Update requirements.txt |
| Import errors | LOW | Low | Medium | Fix test infrastructure |

### Overall Risk Level: **HIGH**

**Recommendation:** Do NOT deploy to production until:
1. All 28 high-severity security issues are resolved
2. Test coverage reaches minimum 60%
3. Top 10 most complex functions are refactored
