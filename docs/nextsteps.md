3. Interactive Code Annotation
4. Binary Diffing and Family Analysis
5. Code Intent Classification
6. Distributed Analysis Framework
7. Source Code Viewer Web Interface
8. Real-time Analysis Dashboard

## First Implementation: Advanced Decompilation Pipeline

The first step will be to create an advanced decompilation pipeline with the following capabilities:

- Integration with multiple decompilers for cross-validation
- Consensus-based output for improved accuracy
- Type inference and propagation across functions
- Control flow graph refinement
- Function signature recovery
- Integration with the modular architecture via pipeline configuration

## Integration with Existing Components

The new capabilities will be integrated with:

- `keyplug_unified_orchestrator.py` as the central coordinator
