Core Steganography Features (based on comments and READMEs, current implementation is placeholder):

Detection Capabilities:
- Intends to detect the presence and type of steganography in images.
- Potential methods mentioned:
    - LSB (Least Significant Bit) analysis.
    - EXIF data analysis.
    - Signatures of specific steganography tools.
- Primary file type focus for detection appears to be JPEG, though PNG is also mentioned in utility contexts.

Extraction Capabilities:
- Intends to extract hidden payloads from images.
- Extraction method would be dependent on the steganography technique identified (e.g., LSB de-interleaving).
- Aims to extract from various steganographic images.

Specific Steganographic Techniques or Image Types Mentioned:
- Techniques:
    - LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography.
    - Use of EXIF data for hiding information.
- Image Types:
    - JPEG (explicitly mentioned for decoding in main README).
    - PNG (mentioned in image utility examples and segment parsing comments).

Auxiliary Features:
- Image loading.
- Parsing of image segments (e.g., JPEG APPn markers, PNG chunks - currently placeholder).
- Image corruption checking.
